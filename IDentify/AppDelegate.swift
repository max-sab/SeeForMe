I designed this app specifically for people with sight disabilities. So it's really easy to use it with specific gestures. Each screen has one button. Other buttons are achievable through vertical swipes. You can also call a command using your voice. Just tap microphone button and say one of four key phrases: 'Read' for reading texts, 'Identify' for identifying colors, 'Text' for looking through saved texts, and 'Color' for looking through saved colors. When you in the specific screen just slide from the edge of the screen to go back. Long tap gesture activates an action and one simple tap stops speaking. In Saved collections screen just swipe on the record to delete it. I hope you will enjoy my app! Peace.")
